    <h2>Simon Pitoni</h2>
    <p>Hallo everyone!!! I am so much excited to be part of this class. My name is Simon Pitoni and I live in Masvingo in Zimbabwe, I am persuing a degree in Applied Technology. In my spare time I love reading, travelling, fishing and spending time with my family. I am married to my wife Ethel and we are blessed with three wonderful children, Russell(6), Alyonna(4) and Brianna (1 week). Brianna was born last week Sunday and the whole family is excited with the new member of the family.</p>
    <p>Currently I am employed as a Universal Banker with CBZ BAnk Ltd and it is here working in the banking industry that I developed a passion to persue a career in Applied technology because technology is everywhere in the banking sector. I have been a member of the church for the past for the past 25 years and my favourite scripture is Alma 37:6-7 "by simole and small things are great things brought to pass". I look forward to working with each and everyone of you and getting to know you better.</p>
